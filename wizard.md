# Morning Report

A quiet, read-only reader for dated Markdown reports (with optional PDF editions) that a scheduled agent job writes into one folder. Newest edition on top, an unread badge on the app's icon for editions you have not read yet, step older or newer from the bottom bar, or open the PDF. The report folder is mounted read-only; the app contains no report content, no schedule and no personal preferences.
